Problem statement:

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

#The naive solution is not totally naive insofar as I write c in terms of a and b
#And I also only test b values up to 1000 - a

        for b in range(1,1000-a):
            if a+b+math.sqrt((a**2) + (b**2)) == 1000.0:

#But this is about 50x faster as it makes use of both equations rather than the Pythagorean one
#The trick in this one is that we have 3 variables: a, b, c satisfying 2 equations
#So heuristically there should be one variable of freedom
#That when constrained to integers restricts that variable to a single value
#Since there's only one variable of freedom, we should be able to write both b and c in terms of a
#And then we need only check that all of a, b, and c are integers.
