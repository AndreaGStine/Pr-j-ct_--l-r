#a bigger challenge

Problem statement:

By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.
By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.
Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.

'''This worked for a solution, but it wasn't terribly robust. I made two big assumptions
Which turned out to be correct, but they were big assumptions nonetheless:
1. As noted in my commentary above primes_is_eligible, I deduced that a number of digits 
divisible by 3 had to be the same digit getting replaced, and then wrote code based on the 
assumption that it would be exactly 3 digits getting replaced, rather than 3 or 6 or 9, et cetera.
2. In what I wrote for checkable_strings, I assumed that all of the eligible primes
had only one collection of 3+ identical digits, when in reality a prime might have had
multiple collections of 3+ identical digits.

I think this is the last Project Euler problem I'll do for the moment. I learned a lot
doing this problem, and it's good practice for implementing algorithms, but I'd like to move on
to something else.

Let's use the sieve solution from Problem 10 to get a nice, big list of primes,
Except I'm using the 'worse' sieve because I don't want to think that hard about indexing

It'd make sense that we'd need to replace multiple digits since
there's 10 total numbers with a given replaced digit, and if we replace only one digit,
at least 3 of them will be divisible by 3, meaning we could only have at most 7 primes!
A little cleverness checking with modular arithmetic verifies that if we replace only 2 digits,
the same is true: If we replace 2 digits, we're incrementing a number by 10^n + 10^k
 = 10^(n-k) * 10^k + 10^k = (10^(n-k) + 1) * 10^k. 10^k = 1 mod 3, so we must be incrementing by
2 mod 3, meaning at least 3 will be divisible by 3.
A little further cleverness demonstrates that we need to replace a number of digits divisible by 3
in order to have an eligible candidate. Which eliminates a lot of our options!
